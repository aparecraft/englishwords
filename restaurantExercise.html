        <strong> Waitress:</strong> Hello, are you ready to order?
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> I am. Are you?
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> Yes, I think so. What is the soup of the day, please?
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> It’s spicy carrot soup.
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> Hm, no. I don’t want that. I’ll start with the mushrooms, please. And after that, can I have the chicken?
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Sure and would you like potatoes chips or rice with your chicken?
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> I’ll have rice, please. Potatoes and chips are too heavy. 
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Fine and you, sir? 
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> Hm, I’d like the tomato and bean salad to start, please.
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Sure. And for your main course?
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> The bacon burger, please. Can I have it without cheese? 
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> No cheese. Sure. And what would like to drink?
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> A beer for me, please. 
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> Really? You usually have wine.
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> That’s true, but I don’t want that today. 
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> Hm, I’ll have a beer too, and could we have some water too?
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Sure. I’ll bring your drinks in a moment.
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> How was your meal?
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> Delicious. Thank you.
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Would you like dessert? The menu is on the wall over there.
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> Yes, I’d love one. But, hm, I can’t decide. The white chocolate cake or the orange cheesecake.
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> Well, I know what I want: an apple pie. 
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Sure. With cream or ice cream?
        <br>
        <strong>Man:</strong> Ice cream, please.
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> No problem. And have you decided?
        <br>
        <strong>Woman:</strong> Well, I had orange cheesecake last time I was here, so I’ll have the white chocolate cake this time.
        <br>
        <strong>Waitress:</strong> Great, I’ll bring them for you soon.
